= Capricorn

Capricorn is a system for building and managing composite Rails applications.
Composite Rails applications are Rails applications which consist only of plugins (gems) and engines (also gems). Capricorn can compose an application for a given specification. It can also update composite applications.

The main purpose of Capricorn is building and maintaining ready-made CMS systems but it can manage any kind of composite application.

Capricorn can be configured to be accessible form an external machine/server through SSL. This makes it possible to manage many servers. This also makes it possible to write a Rails based frontend to the system.
