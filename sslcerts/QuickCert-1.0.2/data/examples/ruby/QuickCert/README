Here's a quick primer on how to get use DRb over SSL.

1) Modify qc_config to suit.  The host I'm writing this on is
   named 'uriel', and my email address is 'drbrain@segment7.net',
   so I filled in the proper entries in the server and client
   certs.

  full_hostname = `hostname`.strip
  domainname = full_hostname.split('.')[1..-1].join('.')
  hostname = full_hostname.split('.')[0]

  CA[:hostname] = hostname
  CA[:domainname] = domainname
  CA[:CA_dir] = File.join Dir.pwd, "CA"
  CA[:password] = '1234'

  CERTS << {
    :type => 'server',
    :hostname => 'uriel',
    :password => '5678',
  }

  CERTS << {
    :type => 'client',
    :user => 'drbrain',
    :email => 'drbrain@segment7.net',
  }

2) Generate the certificates (this may take a while on slower
   machines).

3) Setup the DRb server to use the proper certificates.  They are
   already setup for 'uriel', so you'll have to edit drbssl_s.rb
   to match your configuration.

  cd uriel
  ln -s ../drbssl_s.rb
  ln -s ../CA/cacert.pem
  vi drbssl_s.rb

4) Start the DRb server.  You'll need the server certificate's
   passphrase.

  ruby drbssl_s.rb

5) Setup the DRb client to use the proper certificates.  They are
   already setup for 'drbrain@segment7.net', so you'll have to
   edit drbssl_c.rb to match your configuration.

  cd drbrain
  ln -s ../drbssl_c.rb
  ln -s ../CA/cacert.pem
  vi drbssl_c.rb

6) Start the DRb client.  Then type your name and hit enter.  You
   will get back a message "Hello, <your name>"

  ./drbssl_c.rb
